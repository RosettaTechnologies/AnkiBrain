# 0.4.3 (beta) - August 6, 2023

- Add donate button
- Cloze cards using GPT-4 is now perfect. All users can access GPT-4 via Regular Mode, but local mode users need to have
  access to GPT-4 via their OpenAI account.
- Cloze cards using GPT 3.5 Turbo have been improved in terms of length and content. GPT 3.5 Turbo is capable of
  producing deletions and typically does quite well, but has trouble when in local mode for some reason (most likely due
  to
  library differences between JS and Python). Local mode users may have to manually insert cloze deletions into the
  cloze cards provided by AnkiBrain. Basic cards still work great.

# 0.4.2 (beta) - August 5, 2023

- Rename user_data dir to user_files to prevent Anki from aggressively deleting the folder on addon upgrade. For users
  in Local Mode, this means that this update is the **last time you wil get an error screen** and have to reinstall.
  (*Users can therefore delete the /user_data/ folder in order to save space*)
- Remember AnkiBrain interface (sidepanel) show/hide state
- Add stop button to card generation from document
